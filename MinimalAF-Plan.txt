TODO:
	- Seperate app config and window management from Rendering and updating code. 
	- Move all drawing code into UIElement
	- Split UIElement into multiple files, since it will be big


Later:
 
	- Framebuffer optimization
		- texture buffer resizing [Texture.cs ln 68]
			- currently created with new() each time

	- Custom render pipelines
		- boils down to rendering the same scene and all differently

	- implement Disposable for Audiosource and 	possibly other classes
		since they are now pooled
		
	- Add unit tests for renderbuffer
		- find rare memory corruption that may now be fixed
		
	- Strip down CTX class. Alot of useless stuff there imo

Later later:

	- C# dynamic compilation
