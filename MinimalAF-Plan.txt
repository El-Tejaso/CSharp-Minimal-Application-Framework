TODO:
	- Meta-test to make sure that you can actually make cool and useful things with this framework.
	- Test harness that collates and allows for searching through all unit tests
		- Create An Attribute is used to mark tests
		- Create an element that can aggregate and show all unit tests
		- Allow multiple windows, make a side-window that controls the main window
		- create a Debug window
			- Some way to resize the window
			- Some way to pass constructor args and then restart the test.
				- start making the clipping rect stack-based, and remove SetClippingRect and ClearClippingRect
				-> make some things
				
			-* Some way to see the element tree
				-* Will need to be root-node-state based and done in AfterRender. Also figure out some way to move debug overlay to here as well
	
	-* remove underscore from all the field names. It's awful to look at and type

	
	-* profiling 
		-* Why is it taking up so much memory in RAM
		-* Why is the benchmark so much slower now than it was before?
	
Amazin'		
			
	-* non-immediate support
	
	-* 3D viewport support
	
	-* implement Disposable for Audiosource and possibly other classes
		since they are now pooled

	-* clipping needs to be toggleable
		-* remove setRect
		
	- Framebuffer optimization
		- texture buffer resizing [Texture.cs ln 68]
			- currently created with new() each time
			
	- Add unit tests for renderbuffer
		- find rare memory corruption that may now be fixed
		
	- Strip down CTX class. Alot of useless stuff there imo
					
	-* Add dynamic compilation
		-* find that ms doc page about c# dynamic compilation
