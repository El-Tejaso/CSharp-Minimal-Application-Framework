TODO:
	- Meta-test to make sure that you can actually make cool and useful things with this framework.
	- Test harness that collates and allows for searching through all unit tests
		-* Create An Attribute is used to mark tests
		-* Create an element that can aggregate and show all unit tests
			-* a side-panel that can be hidden/shown and shows all tests
				-* make this an accordion menu in future.
	
	-* non-immediate support
	
	-* 3D viewport support
	
	-* implement Disposable for Audiosource and possibly other classes

	-* clipping needs to be toggleable
		-* remove setRect
		
	- Framebuffer optimization
		- texture buffer resizing [Texture.cs ln 68]
			- currently created with new() each time
			
	- Add unit tests for renderbuffer
