TODO:
	- Meta-test to make sure that you can actually make cool and useful things with this framework.
	- Test harness that collates and allows for searching through all unit tests
		- Create An Attribute is used to mark tests
		- Create an element that can aggregate and show all unit tests
		- Allow multiple windows, make a side-window that controls the main window
		-* create a Debug window
			-* a side-panel that lists all tests that can be searched in
				-* clicking on a test will change what is shown in the main window
			-* a main view that shows the current element tree
	
	-* non-immediate support

		-* remove setRect
		
	- Framebuffer optimization
		- texture buffer resizing [Texture.cs ln 68]
			- currently created with new() each time
			
	- Add unit tests for renderbuffer
