TODO:	
	- non-immediate mode support - retained I think it's called ?
		- 3D viewport support
			- Think about API to:
				- Position camera
				- Alter camera projection
					- Near and far clipping planes
				
				API:
					SetCameraOrientation(Matrix4 transform)
						just sets the view matrix to this
						
					SetCameraProjection(Matrix4 projection)
						just sets the projection matrix
						
					- Can just use OpenTK.Mathematics to make these matrixes, or
						we can add some helpers

		
		-* 3D mesh rendering support
		
		
			-* 3D mesh rendering API
			
		-* Fix framebuffer. I
		-* texture buffer resizing [Texture.cs ln 68]
			-* currently created with new() each time
			
	-* PushDepth, something like pushmatrix but we're settign the 2D depth temporarily. it's like Z-Index in HTML but actually useful
	
	-* Try to understand how the depth is working, and why it doesnt work for 
	numbers greater than 1. Near far clipping planes?
	
Backlog: 
		
	-* implement Disposable for Audiosource and possibly other classes
		since they are now pooled
			
	-* Add unit tests for renderbuffer
		-* find rare memory corruption bug that may now be fixed
		
	Test framework future improvements:
		-* Some way to see the element tree
			-* Will need to be root-node-state based and done in AfterRender. Also figure out some way to move debug overlay to here as well	
	
Distant future:
	-* Add dynamic compilation
		-* find that ms doc page about c# dynamic compilation
		
	-* Why is it taking up so much memory in RAM. reduce this
