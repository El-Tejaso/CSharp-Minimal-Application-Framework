TODO:	
	-> non-immediate mode support - retained I think it's called ?
		-> 3D mesh rendering support
			-* MeshBuilder API. its kinda like StringBuilder (if needed, else backlog this)
			
		-* Fix framebuffer. I
		-* texture buffer resizing [Texture.cs ln 68]
			-* currently created with new() each time
			
	-* PushDepth, something like pushmatrix but we're settign the 2D depth temporarily. it's like Z-Index in HTML but actually useful
	
	-* Try to understand how the depth is working, and why it doesnt work for 
	numbers greater than 1. Near far clipping planes?
	
	-* figure out what we should do with PushMatrix, now that we have other ways of setting the matrix wich will probably be better
	
Backlog: 
	- feature: Modify public properties during test with test harness
		
	- fix: implement Disposable for Audiosource and possibly other classes
		since they are now pooled
			
	- test: Add unit tests for renderbuffer
		-* find rare memory corruption bug that may now be fixed
		
	
	
Distant future:
	- feature: Some way to see the element tree in the test harness
		- Will need to be root-node-state based and done in AfterRender. Also figure out some way to move debug overlay to here as well	
		
	- feature: Add dynamic compilation (in general, not just test harness)
		-* find that ms doc page about c# dynamic compilation
		
	- fix: Why is it taking up so much memory in RAM. reduce this
