TODO:

	- Move ALL application logic to UI rather than entrypoint
		- Replace drawing with canvas
		- UI can be tree based, while game or whatever is ECS or anything

Later:
 
	- Framebuffer optimization
		- texture buffer resizing [Texture.cs ln 68]
			- currently created with new() each time

	- Custom render pipelines
		- boils down to rendering the same scene and all differently

	- implement Disposable for Audiosource and 	possibly other classes
		since they are now pooled
		
	- Add unit tests for renderbuffer
		- find rare memory corruption that may now be fixed

Later later:

	- C# dynamic compilation
