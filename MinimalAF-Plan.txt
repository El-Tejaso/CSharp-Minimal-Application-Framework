TODO:
	-> Give Elements their own coordinate systems, and drawing capabilities. Elements should be able to work anywhere in the subtree.
		- If they are all grounding themselves using Width and Height, I should just be able to give them a different width and height (Happens automatically so I dont have to do anything really), and make the offset based on the screen position. Then use a GLScissor to constrain the drawing. Can still work with 3D cause of viewports.
		
		- It kinda works, I just need to get the stencilling to work.
		-> make input work no matter where the rect is
			- drawing needs to be relative to a rect
				- We shouldnt need to do any calls to CTX. we should just be able to do Rect() from inside the class. may also be helpful to be able to do VW() and VH()
					- make all drawing classes internal static
						- remove references to them in ctx
							- Don't do this. We made those classes, so that we can reuse them in a procedural mesh generation context.
					- copy-paste all the calls into a seperate element partial class. it is mainly for syntactic sugar.
						- view, model, projection matriceis need to be put into an array so that the PushMatrix code can be cleaned up
					- fix tests
					- change all getters and setters to be like Jquery where its like method() is a getter and method(value) is a setter
						- terrible idea. Only do this for methods that invoke drawing related sideeffects or set things elsewhere rather than just raw getters and setters, we should still use Get and Set for state retrieval
					
			-> input needs to be relative to a rect, and should be invokeable in the same way as those other draw calls cause it looks nice
				-> mouse input mainly. use the same syntactic sugar as the drawing API and add input methods directly to the class in a partial extension
					-> Wrap the mouse movement to make it relative
					-* Remove all the redundant methods in the mouse, then copy those over too
						
					-* Create a unit test to test the mouse input
					-* do the same with keyboard input as well for consistency.
			-* clipping needs to be toggleable
				-* remove setRect
			
			
			-* switch brackets back to method() {
			
			-* remove OnStart, replace it with OnMount, OnDismount like REACT, also makes more sense logically speaking
			
			-* Allow elements to define their internal unit width and height with
				SetWidthUnits and SetHeightUnits (100 by default). then we can use VW and VH to get some percentage of that distance. then if my code is drawing osu coordinates, I can do SetHeightunits(600) and then do all my calls normally. 

	-* fix UI API to be able to recalculate itself based on size and not at initialization, so we can do different layouts based on different sizes/aspect ratios etc

	-* 3D immediate and non-immediate support
		
	- Framebuffer optimization
		- texture buffer resizing [Texture.cs ln 68]
			- currently created with new() each time

	- implement Disposable for Audiosource and 	possibly other classes
		since they are now pooled
		
	- Add unit tests for renderbuffer
		- find rare memory corruption that may now be fixed
		
	- Strip down CTX class. Alot of useless stuff there imo
		
	-* Test harness that collates all unit tests
		-* Create An Attribute is used to mark tests
		-* Create a subprogram that can aggregate and show all unit tests
					
	-* Add dynamic compilation
		-* find that ms doc page about c# dynamic compilation
			
	-* Add HSV to Color4

Done so far:
	- Seperate app config and window management from Rendering and updating code. 
		- Move all drawing code into UIElement
		- Split UIElement into multiple files, since it will be big
	- Enough with this wrapper pattern in CTX and Input.
		- rather than CTX.DrawRectangle, do 
			CTX.Rectangle.Draw();
			So I have far less code to maintain
			
	- Move datatypes to where they are needed. Make them Core if they are cross-cutting
		- Removed useless/bad datastructures
	
	- Figure out some way to use System.Drawing.Color because it has a lot more builtin colors
		- added all named colors from wikipedia
