TODO:
	- Meta-test to make sure that you can actually make cool and useful things with this framework.
		- DONE. didnt think it could be done lol
	
	-> remove underscore from all the field names. It's awful to look at and type
	
	-* profiling 
		-* Why is it taking up so much memory in RAM
		-* Why is the benchmark so much slower now than it was before?
	
	
	-* Try to understand how the depth is working, and why it doesnt work for 
	numbers greater than 1. Near far clipping planes?
	
Amazin'		
			
	-* non-immediate support
	
	-* 3D viewport support
	
	-* implement Disposable for Audiosource and possibly other classes
		since they are now pooled

	-* clipping needs to be toggleable
		-* remove setRect
		
	- Framebuffer optimization
		- texture buffer resizing [Texture.cs ln 68]
			- currently created with new() each time
			
	- Add unit tests for renderbuffer
		- find rare memory corruption that may now be fixed
		
	- Strip down CTX class. Alot of useless stuff there imo
					
	-* Add dynamic compilation
		-* find that ms doc page about c# dynamic compilation

	Test framework future improvements:
		-* Some way to see the element tree
			-* Will need to be root-node-state based and done in AfterRender. Also figure out some way to move debug overlay to here as well
