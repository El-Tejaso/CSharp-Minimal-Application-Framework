What to do next
 

- check if I actually need to implement Disposable for Audiosource and possibly other classes
	since they are now pooled
	
- Debug rare immediate mode buffer corruption problem


- implement dynamic compilation (for tests at least, if it cannot be done for entire applications)

- Implement Framebuffer/texture objects that cameras can easily render to. This is an easy way to implement splitscreen
	- can also be implemented with calls to GL.Viewport as well tho. but still it would be cool to have framebuffers for stuff like post processing and cameras rendering to screens and whatnot.
	
	- requires implementing texture buffer resizing. [Texture.cs ln 68]


- Replace OpenTK.Mathematics with System.Numerics, as it seems faster
