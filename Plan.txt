Actions that should be taken when I start working on this again:

- Modify UIInverseStencil to occlude collisions somehow
	- may have to rewrite event system as well

- rename UIInverseStencil to UIInverseStencilRect
- convert UIStateObject into a singleton while we're at it



Current issues that we want to fix / Features that we want to add (work on them top to bottom)

-> Buttons that are a child of a child of a UIInverseStencil element rectangle are still responding to events even though they shouldn;t be
- convert UIStateObject into a singleton
