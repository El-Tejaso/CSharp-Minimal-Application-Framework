What to do next
 

-> implement dynamic compilation (for tests at least, if it cannot be done for entire applications)

- Make the UI code faster to type and iterate

Replace OpenTK.Mathematics with System.Numerics, as it seems faster 

What has already been done

- stop working on the graphical UI editor, as it is simply not worth it. Too much cost, not enough reward. Move it to it's own project if needed


- Make the UI code faster to type and iterate
	- transform names have been made less verbose
