What to do next

-> Make the UI code faster to type and iterate
- implement dynamic compilation (for tests at least, if it cannot be done for entire applications)



What has already been done

- stop working on the graphical UI editor, as it is simply not worth it. Too much cost, not enough reward. Move it to it's own project if needed


- Make the UI code faster to type and iterate
	- transform names have been made less verbose
